You can style the code blocks: `<div></div>` between 2 backticks.

````
// this is multi-line code:

function myExample(firstParam, lastParam) {
  if (firstParam == '```' && lastParam == '```') {
    return superCoolResult;
  }
}
````

You can also make text **bold**...
Or _italic_.
Or even **_both!_**
If you don't need some text just show it: ~~some unneeded text~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and

If you want to create a table there is nothing easier:

| Header one       | Header two | One more Header  |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| text-text        | data-data  | comment-comment  |
| New line of text | More data  | and your comment |

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
    - With different indentation levels.
      - That look like this.

1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And let's not forget embedded images:
